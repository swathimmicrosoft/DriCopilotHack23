DriCopilot for Hack23

DRIs are often overwhelmed by various tasks, such as handling ICMs, root causing the incidents, debug partner reported issues, addressing partner queries via email or stack overflow etc. Many of the partner queries are usually repetitive or can be answered by referring to existing documents. This takes up a lot of DRI's time and as a result DRIs are unable to focus on more urgent tasks.

To solve this problem, we propose DRI Copilot, a chatbot that can assist our partners with their questions and direct them to the relevant sources of information.
Our chatbot will provide quick and best possible answers to partners, and hence will improve customer satisfaction by reducing the waiting time and the need to contact DRIs and in turn reduce the workload of DRIs! Partners can still reach out to DRIs if they need further clarification or if the bot cannot answer their query. The feedback from the partners will be used to improve the chatbotâ€™s performance over time.
